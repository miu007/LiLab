### Postdoctoral scholars
Funding for various postdoctoral opportunities is available on a rolling basis.  If you are interested our research, you are encouraged to send an inquiry and CV to [ronghui.li@nus.edu.sg](mailto:ronghui.li@nus.edu.sg).  We are particularly interested in candidates with expertise in cell biology and regenerative medicine, so if you fit this description please be sure to mention it in your inquiry.

### Doctoral and Master students
We accept graduate students who have already been admitted to School of Medicine Graduate Programme: 

[NUS School of Medicine Graduate Programme](https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/graduatestudies/application-procedures/) <br>


**We cannot directly admit graduate students into our lab.** However, if you are interested in our research, we encourage you to apply to one (or more) of the programs above.  On your application, you can list our lab as one that interests you.  If you are invited for an interview, please reach out and we will try our best to be placed on your interview schedule.  If you are offered admission and want to learn specific details about ongoing projects or joining the lab for your PhD studies (or a research rotation), please contact [ronghui.li@nus.edu.sg](mailto:ronghui.li@nus.edu.sg).

### Undergraduate and master students
If you are a NUS student interested in working in the lab, please fill out the [Undergraduate Research Interest Form](https://forms.office.com/r/QD7qYbh2Et).  We encourage you to fill out this form (rather than to email us directly) to demonstrate that you have read through our website and understand the expectations for undergraduate researchers in our lab.  When positions become available, lab personnel will look through the form responses to identify candidates whose interests and goals align best with their research projects.  At that time, they will reach out to candidates directly to request additional materials (e.g. resume) and schedule interviews. 

If you are an undergraduate student interested in research opportunities or summer internship, we accept students from many different programs.  Some examples include:

[Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme in Science (UROPS)](https://www.science.nus.edu.sg/undergraduates/undergraduate-research/urops/)<br>
[Summer UROPS and Summer URAPS for Exchange Students](https://www.science.nus.edu.sg/undergraduates/study-abroad-programmes/incoming/summer-urops/)<br>
[Final Year Project (FYP)](https://www.dbs.nus.edu.sg/lifesciences/lsm4288/)<br>
[Master Research Project](https://nusgs.nus.edu.sg/)<br>

If you are interested in our research but applying to another research program based at NUS, feel free to contact us and we can determine if we are eligible to take accept student from that program.

### High school students
We accept high school students into our lab who are part of one of the following programs:
